CLUE:
Konstantin Läufer
Regarding project 3, please make as much progress as you can without having had a classroom discussion of the
lambda calculus. In particular, you should aim to do the following over the next few days:

- start with ExprF
- add the required additional branches to your abstract syntax
- extend the functor implementation accordingly
- check the functor laws

Then start to work on substitution as an ExprF-algebra. Please raise questions or share insights here.
