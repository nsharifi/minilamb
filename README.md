## Comparison with Project2a
Upon completion of this project, we compared Projects 2a and 2b. The following is the result of this comparison.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
    </tr>
</table>


|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Modifiability     |More stringent approach. Needs rewrite     | The shapeF factory permits such  feacture to build on top of the existing system |
| Integrability     |   | The cata is an example that it can be easily integrated to the systems |
| Portability       |   | Once the shapeF factory is established user can re-import these functions and use them |
| Performance       |   | With respect to this, the codes have been shorten and certainly enhanced its performance |
| Reliability       |   | Indeed, it took lesser amount of line of codes to once the shapeF factory is established |
| Reusability       |   | Again codes can be re-used for the different roles |
| Scalability       |   | TBD |

## FoldRight

## Conclusion
As shown from the above table, for a simple project, the method used in Project2a is ample in functionality. However, with regards to a extensive architectured structure, Project 2b has the attributes to go on full scale. The example of cata fully demonstrates the robustness of Project 2b
